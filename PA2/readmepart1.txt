This program creates tickets of different types, stores them in 
an array, prints out each ticket stored's type, price and any extra
information, then calculates the profit earned. There are 4 types of tickets:
Regular Tickets, Walkup Tickets, Advance tickets and student advance tickets
(which are a special kind of advance ticket). 

As far as I'm aware the program has no bugs.
